Nerd Night is a Los Angeles based community of curious intellectuals who believe in lifelong learning and the power of sharing knowledge. Our goal is to provide a space for people to get together and geek out about the things they're passionate about. Whether you're into science, history, art, or anything else, there's a place for you here at Nerd Night.

Each Nerd Night is hosted by a member of our community and consists of four speakers. Previous talks have ranged in length (10-30mins) and have included: How to Make an Award Winning Wine, Simulation Theory, and Building 3D Printed Rockets.

Come join and satisfy your curiosity!
